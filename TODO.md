# Todo

## Early user feedback
- There are not enough ways to filter products
- There is no accessibility support for screen readers
- I can't search by product name
- I am seeing lot of products that are out of stock
- I can't see my order history

## Feature backlog
- Some of our API integrations have the credentials hard-coded into our private repository
- We need to display the product image in the cart
- One of our testers reported a crash that recurs once every few days. Cursory investigation hasn't been able to reproduce the issue
- Users on mobile should be able to remove items from their cart with intuitive swipe gestures
- Users should be able to favourite products they like
- The Cart button should be contained within the Navbar and visible on every page
- Once a customer checks out we need to display a receipt in PDF format that comes from from our third-party inventory management system
